### Live Your Life Like a JazzÂ Song

I really like listening to jazz music. There are lots of different styles of jazz, but Free jazz, or Avant-garde jazz hit me in a way that's hard to describe. It's unexpected, sometimes shocking, and often beautiful. I started thinking about how these jazz musicians decided to experiment with sound and really wanted to create something new. Traditional chords and tempos were cast aside. It kept you on your toes. You might not like it the first time you hear it, or the hundredth time, but that's OK if it's not for you. Everyone is unique, and I think jazz music is a reflection of the human condition.

Life is never boring. If it is, you're probably doing it wrong. Sure, we all like to feel comfortable, but if you find yourself looking at a calendar and wondering where the time went I think it's time to change up your chord or tempo. My wife and I recently moved to Oregon. We didn't have any family or friends here. We did a lot of research, but it was largely a leap of faith to move here. We both felt like we were living like Bill Murray in Groundhog's Day. We would try different restaurants, and hang out with friends, but the environment was still the same. We needed the change of pace, scenery, culture, weather, everything. Now every day is an adventure. Sure, after ten years we might feel the same way, but the exciting thing is that we can always move again and try something new.

Don't get stuck in the same old song and dance. If you inject a little change in your life, and challenge yourself, you may be surprised at what you're able to do. Don't life live comfortably. When you feel uncomfortable, take joy in that. You are experiencing life at that moment. The most beautiful things in life often come from the unexpected places.

Planning your life is a good thing, I'm not saying it's not. But life isn't meant to be lived according to a step-by-step guide. You must adapt to changes, and keep your ultimate goals in mind. Just like sailing, we often can't get to the finish line in a straight path. We often feel like we're straying so far off course that it's no use to stay in the race. Take a deep breath, figure out how to course correct, and then keep moving forward. Embrace the failures in life, because that is when we truly learn. Experiment with life like jazz musicians experiment with sound.
