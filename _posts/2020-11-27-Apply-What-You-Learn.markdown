### Apply What You Learn

I have a problem. I have had this problem for a very long time and the only reason I haven't done anything about it yet is that I didn't realize it was a problem until recently. The problem is that over the years I have accumulated knowledge, but failed to apply that knowledge. I encounter a new subject and I'll read books and articles about it, and I might even take notes and come up with a plan to apply that knowledge some day. Only "some day" never comes because I inevitably find something else to learn. And so like a boat that's out at sea, being tossed around by waves with no control over where I'm going, my life is being pushed and pulled into random directions. Sometimes I ask myself, "What is the point of learning?"

I try to set goals for myself. I write them down and try to reread them often to remind myself what my priorities should be. I often find myself going down a path that doesn't align with any of my goals but happens to be interesting or thought provoking, and by the time I realize that it's too late. There I go again, being tossed around with no sense of direction. It's interesting that I enjoy this chaotic learning style, otherwise, why would I do it? I do it because it's easy, and it fools me into thinking I'm spending my time wisely.

The opposite of this behavior is going deep. It's easy to stay on the surface of ideas, and bounce from one to the next. It's harder to stop and really understand what you've just read, and harder still to seek out new information to either confirm or possibly challenge your belief. But that is what applying knowledge is all about. You just read about something that managed to hold your attention for a few minutes, or hours, or days. Don't just jump to the next thing. You're doing yourself an injustice by not going deep.

**Here is what I'm trying to do now:**

While reading something I'll either highlight passages that pique my interest in some way, or I'll write it down. Later, I'll revisit my notes and see if it's still interesting to me. Sometimes it's not, but sometimes it's so interesting that I can't stop myself from thinking. This is good. Next I will answer some questions about what I noted:

1. Why do I find this interesting?
2. How can I learn more about this?
3. How can I apply what I've learned right away?
4. Is there anyone I know who I could discuss this with?

This normally leads me to additional information and I'll repeat the four steps above.

Now look, I don't expect everyone to do this for _every_ thing they learn, I sure don't. But I believe we need to be selective about things, otherwise we're back to being in that boat again. But sometimes we'll come across an idea that actually aligns with a goal we have. That's when the sirens should be going off in your head. Stop and figure out how you can apply what you're learning. Even if it's just answering question one, "Why do I find this interesting?", that can be just enough to gain some insight about yourself.
