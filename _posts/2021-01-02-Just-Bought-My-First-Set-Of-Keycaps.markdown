I just recently got into the mechanical keyboard hobby and after a few days of learning what this scene was about, I was surprised it took me this long to discover it. The mechanical keyboard hobby shares a lot with other hobbies I have. I love the personalization aspect of it, just like how I love modding cars. If you type on a keyboard all day long it seems logical that you would want to use a tool that looked, sounded and felt good to you. Artists spend a lot of time picking out their favorite tools, so why wouldn't someone like an IT guy not want the same? I remember back in the early 2000's I was working at a company and was going through some old IT gear and came across a mechanical keyboard. I didn't realize the historical significance at the time, but it ended up being an IBM Model M. I wish I had kept that board, just for nostalgic reasons, although the whole point of building custom boards is that you're putting it together the way _you_ want and so in theory it should be "the best". At least until your preferences change.

Now I am just typing, just typing and getting a feel for these new keycaps. They were recommended by a coworker and fellow keyboard aficionado, from a company called PimpMyKeyboards which is a Signature Plastics company. SP has been doing keycaps for a long time. These keys are a SA-P profile which have a really tall profile. I honestly didn't realize how much variance there was in keycaps. I have used keyboards in the past where I just didn't like the feel of them, but I never took the time to wonder why. These keycaps are on [MX Clear switches](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-clear.html) and a WASD model V2 board. The switches feel pretty heavy, and after a few minutes of typing I feel fatigued. I make mistakes a lot and I didn't realize it _could_ have been because typing on these keys requires a lot of endurance. You wouldn't think that that would be a problem, but man, every few minutes of typing I'll need to take a break and stretch out my fingers.

So there are a lot of different switches out there, but they can be grouped into three buckets: clicky, tactile, and linear. The clicky ones will annoy anyone in an office envronment but they do sound cool. ([But not as cool as this](https://youtu.be/ZT9CHub9Cxs)) The MX Clears are apparently tactile switches but I can't feel the tactile bump they're supposed to have. I think that when I use some linear switches that's when I'll actually feel the difference. I bought a set of NK Cream linear switches as part of the "starter pack" that RAMA WORKS sold.
